## Purpose

I created this project during my learning of HTML5 Canvas. Initially, it consisted solely of a canvas element on a white background, with a snake moving inside a rectangular box. As development progressed, I decided to enhance its visual appeal by adding a background image to simulate an old arcade gaming station. Additionally, being a passionate gamer myself, I incorporated ambient soundtracks and sound effects to infuse the game with more fun and excitement.


## Lessons Learned
  During the course of working on this project, I acquired a deeper understanding of HTML Canvas functionality. Exploring the principles behind snake game programming and mechanics proved to be particularly intriguing, providing me with valuable insights into game development.

Moreover, it was my first encounter with utilizing an image as a background for an entire page, which necessitated learning how to configure it for responsiveness. This aspect added a layer of complexity to the project, but it also expanded my skills in web design and layout optimization.
